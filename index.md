Why?

- Find the best possible journal for exactly my topic/subject and my audience
- Find, compare and evaluate several journals in my field
- Find alternative journals to submit to in the unlikely event that I'm rejected
- Find alternative journals that I didn't know of before - just as an orientation
- Check time from submission to first decision and published article
- Avoid to submit to a shady publisher


Finally arrive to a well motivated decision of a journal where to send my manuscript...

*"I have choosen to submit to the journal International Journal of Fracture because it is perfect for my topic, they accept the kind of article I have written, the metrics of the journal seems to be fairly good, the journal is covered by the major databases in my field, there is an Open Access option and the APC will be covered by the library, the turn-around-time and acceptance rate seems fairly decent and my supervisor is also happy about my decison. By checking all aspects of this journal I also know that it isn't among the shady journals that sometimes are called predatory."*


## 1. Find a candidate based on topic/subject, article type and study type:

#### *The aim is to enter an abstract, and possibly a title and some keywords into a database and get examples of journals that has published in similar topics before.*



Search in general non publisher-specific databases:

- [Dimensions.ai](https://www.dimensions.ai/) (First click on the "Access for free" button. Then click in the search field and choose "Abstract Search". Paste in your abstract and PRESS CARRIAGE RETURN - THIS IS NON-OBVIOUS. You can filter your results in the left hand menu. The journals will be visible in the right menu under the header "SOURCE TITLES".

- [EdanzJournal Selector](https://en-author-services.edanzgroup.com/journal-selector)  (Choose "Abstract/Keyword" in the left drop-down menu and paste your abstract in the search field)

- [JANE](http://jane.biosemantics.org/) (*Biomedicine only*, paste in your abstract and search)

- [Web of Science Master Journals List](https://mjl.clarivate.com/home)  (More info when logged in)


Publisher specific:

- [American Chemical Society](https://publish.acs.org/publish/)

- [Elsevier](https://journalfinder.elsevier.com/)

- [IEEE](https://publication-recommender.ieee.org/home)

- [Springer Nature](https://journalsuggester.springer.com/)

- [Taylor & Francis](https://authorservices.taylorandfrancis.com/how-to-choose-a-journal/)

## 2. Check coverage/indexing in major bibliographic databases

    Google Scholar is not a major bibliographic database!
    Database indexing is often indicated on the journal webpages, see example at T&F


General databases:

Web of Science Master Journals List  (mer info om man är inloggad)

Scopus Sources

Journal Guide  (not exhaustive, search for a journal and look at indices in the right hand menu)


Subject specific:

Analytical Abstracts

Art & Architecture Complete

Chemical Abstracts/SciFinder

EconLit

Ei Compendex (find excel-sheet on page)

GEOBASE (find excel-sheet on page)

GeoRef

Inspec

Library, Information Science & Technology Abstracts

Materials Science & Engineering Database

MathSciNet (click on the journals tab)

Philosopher’s Index -

Sociological Abstracts -

zbMATH


## 3. Check journal ranking in your subject

    Remember to never compare two journals from different subject areas unless the indicator used is field-normalized
    SJR and SNIP are field-normalized, JIF and CiteScore are not

CWTS Journal Indicators (SNIP - based on citation data from Scopus. To be noted CWTS Leiden Ranking is based on Web of Science data)

Scimago Journal & Country Rank (SJR - based on citation data from Scopus)

Journal Citations Reports (Journal Impact Factor (JIF) - based on citation data from Web of Science)

Scopus Sources (CiteScore, SJR, SNIP - based on citation data from Scopus)

"Norwegian list" (based on expert panels)


## 4. Check the Open Access options
